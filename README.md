## About
CardCraft is a mod all about collecting Trading Cards. You can then either show them off or use them in Duels (coming soon)! Each card features familiar faces from Minecraft along with many jokes and references (I'd be suprised if you got all of them)

Booster Packs are your primary way of gettings new cards, which can be found in Dungeon and Village chests. In the future, you can also trade cards with a Villager!

As always, installing [JEI](https://modrinth.com/mod/jei) or equivalents will be the best way to view the items and recipes this mod offers

## FAQ

<summary>Open FAQ</summary>

Q: **Why release now?**<br>
A: Because I want feedback and testing from other people. That, and... because I felt like it

Q: **cAn YoU aDd SuPpOrT fOr VeRsIoN (insert version here)!!?**<br>
A: Currently, there are no plans to downgrade to any lower versions. Also most content mods are on 1.20.1 right now, so there isn't really a point to update to the latest versions yet

Q: **WhAt AbOuT fAbRiC/qUiLt?!?**<br>
A: That would require me to learn another mod loader, which isn't feasible right now. That doesn't mean there aren't plans in the future, though...

Q: **Why is this a question?**<br>
A: Because I want it here
