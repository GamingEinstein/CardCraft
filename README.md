# CardCraft - A Collectible Trading Card Mod

Become the Ultimate Trading Card Collector!<br>
Travel across the lands to loot, trade, and fight in order to collect them all!

Currently, there are 10 cards for you to collect, featuring familiar faces and items from Minecraft

This mod is greatly inspired by Buddycards. I wanted to take my own spin on a mod about collecting cards, so this project was born

*Coming Soon: A way to play CardCraft as a game! It will come when there are more cards added and I have thought out the game!*<br>

*This mod is in early development. Expect many things to be broken or missing (textures,
features, items) along with tons of bugs. I code for fun and when I feel like doing do, so don't expect fast or massive updates constantly*
